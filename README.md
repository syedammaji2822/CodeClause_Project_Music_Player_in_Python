# This is a Music player program which is written in python
##Project Requirements

make sure that you have Python installed in your machine and a code editor, too. In this case any code editor will be fine, including Pycharm, VS Code, Atom or any of your choice.

Use the command below to check whether Python is installed. This command works no matter the operating system you are using, including Windows, Mac and Linux systems:

#python --version
Having ensured that we have everything set correctly from this step, we can now move to the next step that is installing necessary libraries required for this particular project.

#Python Libraries Needed
In order for us to have our application up and running, we will need to make use of some Python libraries that will make it easier to develop the application by adding some functionalities and interactivity to our application. They include:

Tkinter – Used to create a GUI interface for our application.
Pygame – Used to include the sound libraries designed to be used with Python.
Now that we have the main libraries required, let’s get started with our development with a step by step guide through each step accompanied with an explanation of what is happening.

You can also get access to the project code available on GitHub here.
